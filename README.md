# Alien Communication System:

Aliens have arrived on Earth and are trying to communicate with humans. They have a unique communication system that involves sending signals in small tasks (microtasks) and large tasks (macrotasks). Write a program that demonstrates the event loop in JavaScript by simulating the processing of microtasks and macrotasks. Show how the event loop prioritizes the tasks and processes them in the correct order.
